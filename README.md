## Description

I created Cloud-Coverage to display upcoming weather events for different cities.

It is a simple set of HTML elements that are updated with upcoming weather data upon user input.

I accomplisehd this by leveraging the openweathermap api.

## Usage

Simply visit https://hevidevi.github.io/Cloud-Coverage/ and input a city in the field abouve the sumbit button. You may either click the submit button or click Enter.
